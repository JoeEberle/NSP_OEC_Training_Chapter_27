## 27.1 Describe how plants and fungi can be harmful to humans 

Plants can be harmful to humans by producing **toxic substances** that cause poisoning when ingested, touched, or inhaled, such as in the case of poison ivy or deadly nightshade. Fungi can lead to **infections**, like athlete's foot and ringworm, or produce **mycotoxins** (toxic compounds), which can contaminate food and cause serious health issues if ingested. Additionally, certain airborne fungi release **spores** that can trigger allergies or respiratory problems.

## 27.2 Describe how mushrooms can be harmful to humans. 

Mushrooms can be harmful to humans primarily through **toxic poisoning**, as some wild mushrooms contain dangerous toxins that can cause symptoms ranging from **gastrointestinal distress** (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) to severe **organ failure** and even death. Consuming certain types, like the **Amanita** species (e.g., death cap), can lead to **liver and kidney damage**, often with delayed symptoms that make early diagnosis difficult. Additionally, **hallucinogenic mushrooms** can cause psychological effects, confusion, and dangerous behavior, while airborne spores from some fungi can trigger **allergic reactions** or respiratory problems.

## 27.3 Describe and demonstrate how to assess a patient who has been injured following an encounter with a toxic plant, an animal, or marine life. 

Assessing a patient who has been injured after contact with a toxic plant, animal, or marine life involves a systematic approach to determine the severity of the injury and provide appropriate care. Here are the steps to describe and demonstrate the assessment:

### 1. **Scene Safety and Precautions**

   - **Initiate standard precautions** such as wearing gloves to prevent accidental contact with any remaining toxins.

### 2. **Initial Assessment (ABCs)**
   - **Airway**: Check if the airway is clear. Be vigilant for any signs of swelling or obstruction, especially if there has been contact with a venomous animal or inhalation of toxic plant fumes.
   - **Breathing**: Assess breathing by looking, listening, and feeling. Check for **wheezing, shortness of breath, or abnormal sounds**, which may indicate an allergic reaction or respiratory distress.
   - **Circulation**: Check for pulse and signs of **shock** (e.g., pale, clammy skin, rapid heartbeat, low blood pressure). Be alert for symptoms like **dizziness or fainting**, which may indicate a severe systemic reaction.

### 3. **Focused Physical Examination**
   - **Skin Assessment**: Examine the skin for **redness, swelling, rashes, blisters, or puncture wounds**. Note the location and extent of any reactions, including spreading redness or swelling.
   - **Bite, Sting, or Contact Marks**: Look for specific signs such as **bites, stings, punctures, or contact dermatitis**. Document the appearance and any **oozing, bruising, or signs of infection**.
   - **Pain Assessment**: Ask the patient about the level and type of pain they are experiencing (e.g., sharp, burning, throbbing) and if it is spreading or localized.

### 4. **Medical History and Symptoms Inquiry**
   - **Ask About the Exposure**: Get details on **when, where, and how** the exposure occurred. Ask if the patient can identify the plant, animal, or marine life involved.
   - **Allergies and Past Reactions**: Check if the patient has a history of **allergies**, especially to plants, animals, or stings, and if they have had similar reactions before.
   - **Onset of Symptoms**: Inquire about the **timing of symptoms** (e.g., immediate or delayed onset), including **difficulty breathing, nausea, dizziness, numbness, tingling, or swelling**.

### 5. **Monitoring for Signs of Severe Reactions**
   - **Anaphylaxis Symptoms**: Be alert for signs of **anaphylaxis**, such as **hives, facial swelling, difficulty breathing, and rapid onset of symptoms**. Immediate intervention with **epinephrine** may be needed if available.
   - **Systemic Symptoms**: Look for signs of systemic involvement, like **muscle weakness, abdominal pain, vomiting, confusion, or seizures**, which may indicate the spread of toxins throughout the body.

### 6. **Document and Record Findings**
   - **Document All Findings**: Record all physical observations, vital signs, and the patient's description of symptoms. Note any visible injuries, the extent of the reaction, and changes in the patient’s condition.
   - **Take Photos if Possible**: If feasible, take **photos** of the affected area for further medical evaluation, especially if the patient is unsure of the exact source of exposure.

### Summary of Steps:
1. **Scene Safety**: Ensure safety and wear gloves to prevent contamination.
