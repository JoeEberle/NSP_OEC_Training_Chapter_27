<h2 id="271-describe-how-plants-and-fungi-can-be-harmful-to-humans">27.1 Describe how plants and fungi can be harmful to humans</h2>
<p>Plants can be harmful to humans by producing <strong>toxic substances</strong> that cause poisoning when ingested, touched, or inhaled, such as in the case of poison ivy or deadly nightshade. Fungi can lead to <strong>infections</strong>, like athlete's foot and ringworm, or produce <strong>mycotoxins</strong> (toxic compounds), which can contaminate food and cause serious health issues if ingested. Additionally, certain airborne fungi release <strong>spores</strong> that can trigger allergies or respiratory problems.</p>
<h2 id="272-describe-how-mushrooms-can-be-harmful-to-humans">27.2 Describe how mushrooms can be harmful to humans.</h2>
<p>Mushrooms can be harmful to humans primarily through <strong>toxic poisoning</strong>, as some wild mushrooms contain dangerous toxins that can cause symptoms ranging from <strong>gastrointestinal distress</strong> (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) to severe <strong>organ failure</strong> and even death. Consuming certain types, like the <strong>Amanita</strong> species (e.g., death cap), can lead to <strong>liver and kidney damage</strong>, often with delayed symptoms that make early diagnosis difficult. Additionally, <strong>hallucinogenic mushrooms</strong> can cause psychological effects, confusion, and dangerous behavior, while airborne spores from some fungi can trigger <strong>allergic reactions</strong> or respiratory problems.</p>
